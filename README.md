📌 **Overview**

This project analyzes pizza sales data to understand business performance, customer ordering behavior, and product-level trends. The analysis was performed using SQL for business logic and Power BI for data cleaning, modeling, and visualization. The goal is to deliver actionable insights through interactive dashboards to support sales optimization and decision-making.

📂 **Dataset**

Dataset Name: Pizza Sales Dataset

Format: CSV

Data Type: Transactional sales data

Key Columns:

Order ID

Order Date

Pizza Name

Pizza Category

Pizza Size

Quantity

Total Price


🛠 **Tools & Technologies**

Power BI

Power Query (data cleaning & transformation)

DAX (measures & calculations)

SQL

PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server

Gamma

Report and PPT creation

CSV File

Data source


🔍 ** Data Cleaning & Transformation (Power Query)**

Data cleaning was performed directly inside Power BI using Power Query:

Loaded the CSV dataset into Power BI

Removed duplicate records

Verified correct data types for date and numeric columns

Cleaned and standardized column names

Validated quantity and total price values

Ensured data consistency before modeling

📊  **  Feature Engineering & Measures (DAX)
**
Business metrics were created using DAX measures, including:

Total Revenue

Total Orders

Total Pizzas Sold

Average Order Value

Average Pizzas per Order

Additional derived insights:

Sales percentage by pizza category

Sales percentage by pizza size

Ranking of best- and worst-selling pizzas

🧮 ** SQL Analysis ** 
SQL queries were used to perform detailed business analysis:

Revenue calculations

Order trends (daily and monthly)

Category-wise and size-wise sales analysis

Top 5 best-selling pizzas

Bottom 5 worst-selling pizzas

Quantity-based product analysis

SQL helped validate insights and supported Power BI visualizations.

📈 ** Dashboard**
 
An interactive Power BI dashboard was created with:

KPI cards for revenue, orders, and pizzas sold

Daily and monthly sales trend charts

Category-wise and size-wise sales distribution

Best and worst seller visuals

The dashboard allows stakeholders to explore performance metrics dynamically.

📊 ** Results & Insights** 

Certain pizza categories and sizes generate the majority of revenue

Sales follow clear daily and monthly demand patterns

A small set of pizzas accounts for a large portion of total sales

Customers frequently order multiple pizzas per transaction
